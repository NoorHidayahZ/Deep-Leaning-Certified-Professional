| What is the primary feature that differentiates a pandas Series from a NumPy array?                                                                        | b) Axis labels for indexing                   | **Answer: b**<br>**Justification:** The primary feature that differentiates a pandas Series from a NumPy array is that a Series can have axis labels for indexing. This allows for indexing by labels, in addition to numerical locations, making it more flexible and versatile for data manipulation.                                                               |
| How would you create a pandas Series from the given data and labels?<br>`data = [10, 20, 30]`<br>`labels = ['a', 'b', 'c']`                               | c) `pd.Series(data=data, index=labels)`      | **Answer: c**<br>**Justification:** To create a pandas Series from the given data and labels, you would use the `pd.Series()` function with the `data` and `index` arguments. The correct syntax would be `pd.Series(data=data, index=labels)`.                                                                                                                          |
| What data type does a pandas Series hold if the data contains different Python objects like strings?                                                       | a) `object`                                   | **Answer: a**<br>**Justification:** A pandas Series can hold a variety of object types, including strings and other Python objects. If the data in a Series contains different Python objects, the data type of the Series will be `object`.                                                                                                                          |
| How can you access the element with the label 'China' from the Series `sales_Q1`?                                                                          | a) `sales_Q1['China']`                       | **Answer: a**<br>**Justification:** To access the element with the label 'China' from the Series `sales_Q1`, you can use the square bracket notation with the label as the index, like `sales_Q1['China']`. This will return the value associated with the label 'China' in the Series.                                                                    |
| What will be the result of `sales_Q1 + sales_Q2`?                                                                                                          | d) Some elements with NaN (Not a Number)     | **Answer: d**<br>**Justification:** When performing operations between two Series, pandas aligns the data based on the index. If there are elements in one Series that do not have a corresponding match in the other Series, the result will be `NaN`. In this case, the result will have some elements with `NaN`.                                                  |
| Which of the following statements is true about indexing in a pandas Series?                                                                              | c) Indexing allows for fast lookups          | **Answer: c**<br>**Justification:** In pandas Series, indexing plays a crucial role. It allows for fast lookups of information, similar to how a hash table or dictionary works. This is because pandas uses the index names or numbers to quickly retrieve data, making data manipulation and access efficient.                                                |
| What will be the output of `pd.Series([sum, print, len])`?                                                                                                 | b) Series holding references to functions    | **Answer: b**<br>**Justification:** A pandas Series can hold various object types, including functions. The expression `pd.Series([sum, print, len])` creates a Series where each element is a reference to a built-in function (`sum`, `print`, `len`). These functions can be accessed and used later in the code. |
| Suppose you have two Series, `ser1` and `ser2`. Which line of code will correctly add the elements of both Series and handle elements with missing matches?    | a) `ser1.add(ser2, fill_value=0)`            | **Answer: a**<br>**Justification:** The `add()` method with `fill_value` parameter can be used to add the elements of both Series while handling missing matches. It will align the Series based on the index and fill any missing values with 0, then perform the addition.                                                                                           |
| What happens if you try to access the element with the label 'Russia' from the Series `sales_Q1` using `sales_Q1['Russia']`?                                | c) KeyError: 'Russia'                        | **Answer: c**<br>**Justification:** If you try to access an element using a label that does not exist in the Series, it will raise a `KeyError`. In this case, trying to access `sales_Q1['Russia']` will raise a `KeyError` because 'Russia' is not a valid label in the given Series.                                              |
| Which of the following data types can a pandas Series hold?                                                                                                | d) All of the above                          | **Answer: d**<br>**Justification:** A pandas Series can hold a wide variety of data types, including numeric data (integers, floats), strings, objects, functions, etc. It can virtually hold any arbitrary Python object, making it a versatile data structure for various types of data.                   |

4. Markov Decision Process (MDP) Question:
   Which components are essential for defining a Markov Decision Process (MDP)?
   Options:
   - A. State space, action space, and reward function.
   - B. State space, decision space, and cost function.
   - C. Observation space, action space, and transition probabilities.
   - D. State space, decision space, and transition probabilities.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: The essential components for defining a Markov Decision Process (MDP) are the state space, action space, and reward function. The state space contains all possible states, the action space contains all possible actions, and the reward function defines the immediate reward received by the agent for taking a specific action in a state.

5. Reinforcement Learning Question:
   What is the role of an exploration strategy in Reinforcement Learning (RL)?
   Options:
   - A. To exploit the current knowledge to maximize rewards.
   - B. To estimate the value function of the environment.
   - C. To find the optimal policy by trying different actions.
   - D. To convert the continuous state space to a discrete one.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The role of an exploration strategy in Reinforcement Learning (RL) is to encourage the agent to try different actions in the environment. Exploration is essential to discover new, potentially more rewarding states and actions and to avoid getting stuck in suboptimal solutions.

6. Markov Decision Process (MDP) Question:
   What is the discount factor (gamma) used for in MDP?
   Options:
   - A. To reduce the size of the state space.
   - B. To speed up the convergence of the value iteration algorithm.
   - C. To control the impact of future rewards in the agent's decisions.
   - D. To reduce the complexity of the action space.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The discount factor (gamma) in Markov Decision Process (MDP) is used to control the impact of future rewards in the agent's decisions. A value of gamma close to 1 means the agent considers long-term rewards, while a value close to 0 makes the agent focus only on immediate rewards.

7. Reinforcement Learning Question:
   What is the main difference between value iteration and policy iteration algorithms in Reinforcement Learning (RL)?
   Options:
   - A. Value iteration is model-free, while policy iteration is model-based.
